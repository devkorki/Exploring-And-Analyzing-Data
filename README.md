## Project Overview

We analyzed and forecasted **daily temperature data** from 2022–2023 using various statistical and time series forecasting methods.

The data is sourced from the **National Observatory of Athens / meteo.gr**, covering cities such as Athens, Ioannina, Thessaloniki, and more.

## Project Structure

- `ITC6002 Project Team 1.py`: Main Python script containing all data processing, forecasting methods, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Folder containing raw `.csv` datasets for each city.

## Techniques Used

### ➤ Data Cleaning
- Handling missing values (`---`) using moving averages
- Outlier detection using interquartile range
- Forward/backward filling of gaps

### ➤ Forecasting Methods
- **Moving Average (MA)**
- **Weighted Moving Average (WMA)**
- **Exponential Smoothing (ES)**
- **Trend-adjusted Forecasting using Linear Regression**
- **Trend + Seasonality using Adaptive Multiplicative Model**

Each method includes **parameter optimization** based on **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**.

## Questions Addressed

1. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned raw temperature datasets from multiple cities.
2. **Year 1 Forecasting**: Predicted February–December based on January using multiple methods.
3. **Trend Analysis**: Estimated linear trend and adjusted forecasts.
4. **Seasonality Detection**: Applied seasonality-adjusted forecasting models.
5. **Year 2 Validation**: Repeated analysis using the second year to validate models.
6. **Cross-city Comparison**: Compared performance across 10+ cities using monthly snapshots.
